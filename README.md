# weather-station

A Particle based weather station. The code here is copied from some official
example and I forgot where it's from. Sorry. Also, it's a mess...

The weather station will send data directly to ThingSpeak and not use particle.io APIs.

To use this project you should be familiar with the [Particle platform]
(https://particle.io), Arduinos in general, and [ThingSpeak](https://thingspeak.com).
